Once a fox and a crane became friends. So, the fox invited the crane to dinner. The crane
accepted the invitation and reached the fox's place at sunset.
The fox had prepared soup for his mate. But as we all know that foxes are cunning by
nature, he served the soup in flat dishes. So, he himself lapped the crane's share with his
tongue enjoying its relish a lot. But the crane could not enjoy it at all with his long beak and
had to get back home hungry. The shrewd fox felt extremely amused.
After few days, the crane invited the fox to dine in with him. The fox reached his place well
in time. The crane gave him a warm welcome and served the soup in a jug with a long and
narrow neck.
So, the crane enjoyed the soup with great relish using his long beak. The fox's mouth
couldn't reach the soup through the narrow neck of the jug. He had to return home hungry.
Now he realized that he had been repaid for his behaviour with the crane.
